{"query": "What protein is associated with presynaptic components in the human CNS?", "answer": "The protein alpha-synuclein is associated with presynaptic components in the human CNS.", "doc1": "The spectrin heterodimer is formed by the antiparallel lateral association of an alpha and a beta subunit, each of which comprises largely a series of homologous triple-helical motifs. Initiation of dimer assembly involves strong binding between complementary motifs near the actin-binding end of the dimer. In this study, the mechanism of lateral spectrin association at this dimer nucleation site was investigated using the analytical ultracentrifuge to analyze heterodimers formed from recombinant peptides containing two or four homologous motifs from each subunit (alpha20-21/beta1-2; alpha18-21/beta1-4).", "doc2": "It is increasingly clear that the normal protein alpha-synuclein is in some manner closely associated with presynaptic components of select neuronal types within the adult human central nervous system (CNS) and, in addition, that in its pathologically altered state alpha-synuclein aggregates selectively in the form of filamentous inclusion bodies during certain progressive neurodegenerative disorders, such as familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease."}
{"query": "What does NE enhance the release of?", "answer": "NE enhances the release of arachidonic acid (AA).", "doc1": "Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) affects lipid metabolism by inhibiting the activity of lipoprotein and endothelial lipases. Angptl3 knockout mice have marked hypolipidemia, and heterozygous carriers of ANGPLT3, loss-of-function mutations were found among individuals in the lowest quartile of plasma triglycerides in population studies. Recently, 4 related individuals with primary hypolipidemia were found to be compound heterozygotes for ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations.", "doc2": "We have investigated the contribution of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) in norepinephrine (NE)-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release in rabbit aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). NE enhanced release of AA via activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) but not secretory PLA2 in VSMC prelabeled with [3H]AA. NE (10 microM) enhanced CaM kinase II and MAP kinase activity. In cells transiently transfected with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the translation initiation sites of CaM kinase II and MAP kinase, NE-induced AA release was inhibited by 100 and 35% respectively."}
{"query": "What is Restless legs syndrome (RLS) recognized as a cause for?", "answer": "RLS is recognized as a cause for insomnia in adults.", "doc1": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has gradually been recognized as a cause for insomnia in adults, but there have been few reports about children with RLS in Japan. Here we described seven pediatric RLS patients. All of the parents of our patients had difficult times to make their children sleep due to irritability, restlessness, and demanding bedtime routines. All patients had asked their parents to rub their feet in bed, and it took more than half an hour to soothe them until they fell asleep. Their mothers had been exhausted from this night-time routine.", "doc2": "Recently, bi-allelic mutations in the transcription factor RFX6 were described as the cause of a rare condition characterized by neonatal diabetes with pancreatic and biliary hypoplasia and duodenal/jejunal atresia. A male infant developed severe hyperglycemia (446\u2009mg/dL) within 24\u2009h of birth. Acute abdominal concerns by day five necessitated exploratory surgery that revealed duodenal atresia, gallbladder agenesis, annular pancreas and intestinal malrotation. He also exhibited chronic diarrhea and feeding intolerance, cholestatic jaundice, and subsequent liver failure. He died of sepsis at four months old while awaiting liver transplantation."}

{"query": "What are the MIC values exhibited by Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA)?", "answer": "Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) exhibit oxacillin MIC values of 1-8 microg ml(-1).", "doc1": "Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) exhibit oxacillin MIC values of 1-8 microg ml(-1), but lack mecA, which encodes the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a. The relationship of the BORSA phenotype with specific genetic backgrounds was assessed, as well as amino acid sequence variation in the normal PBP2. Among 38 BORSA, 26 had a common PFGE profile of genomic DNA, and were multilocus sequence type (ST)25. The other isolates were genetically diverse. Complete pbp2 sequences were determined for three BORSA, corresponding to ST25, ST1 and ST47, which were selected on the basis of lacking blaZ-encoded beta-lactamase.", "doc2": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered group of small RNA molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression. Analogously to mRNAs, the non-protein-encoding pri-miRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II and post-transcriptionally modified by addition of a 5'-cap and a 3'-poly (A) tail. Subsequently, the pri-miRNA undergoes a number of processing steps in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and ends up as a mature approximately 22 nt miRNA, which can exert its function by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of a subset of mRNAs."}

Data from a variety of sources provide a compelling argument that the amount of iron in the brain is lower in individuals with restless legs syndrome compared with neurologically normal individuals. Moreover, a significant percentage of patients with restless legs syndrome are responsive to intravenous iron therapy. The mechanism underlying the decreased iron concentrations in restless legs syndrome brains is unknown. We hypothesize that the source of the brain iron deficit is at the blood-brain interface.", "doc2": "Varespladib methyl is an oral secretory phospholipase A2 inhibitor that is being developed by Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc for the potential treatment of coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome and inflammation. Varespladib methyl is a prodrug that is rapidly metabolized to varespladib, and both compounds are able to potently inhibit the enzymes of the human secretory phospholipase groups IIa, V and X, which play a pivotal role in atherosclerotic disease and inflammation. Phase II clinical trials of varespladib methyl in patients with coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and ulcerative colitis revealed that the drug was well tolerated."}
