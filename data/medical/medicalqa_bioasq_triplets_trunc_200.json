Thus, understanding the mechanisms of DNA repair and mutagenesis in such arrested cells may help unravel the complex process of tumorigenesis. Two major nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways are known to remove bulky physical or chemical lesions from DNA.

The bone stores large amounts of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors and transforming growth factor-b, and provides fertile soil for metastatic cancer cells by continuously releasing these bone-stored growth factors, which are a consequence of osteoclastic bone resorption.

In this review article, the risks and benefits of standard diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are presented to guide clinicians through this critical period of decision making.

CircRNAs are conserved across different species and display specific organization, sequence, and expression in disease. Moreover, circRNAs' closed ring structure, insensitivity to RNase, and stability are advantages over linear RNAs in terms of development and application as a new kind of clinical marker. In addition, according to recent studies, circular RNA-7 (ciRS-7) acts as a sponge of miR-7 and thus inhibits its activity. Numerous evidences have confirmed expression of miR-7 is dysregulated in cancer tissues, however, whether ciRS-7 invovled in oncogenesis by acting as sponge of miR-7 remains unclear."}, {"query": "What was the primary endpoint of the trial evaluating the effects of empagliflozin added to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes?", "doc1": "Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile.

Patients typically develop many tumors over their lifetime, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The NF1 gene, mutated in NF1, is also commonly mutated in sporadic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Because both NF1 and GBM are currently incurable, new therapeutic approaches are clearly needed. Natural products represent an opportunity to develop new therapies, as they have been evolutionarily selected to play targeted roles in organisms. Schweinfurthin A is a prenylated stilbene natural product that has previously shown specific inhibitory activity against brain and hematopoietic tumor lines.", "doc2": "Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is difficult, since symptoms are often very unspecific or lacking. However active, prompt and accurate diagnosis is the key element in the public health response to tuberculosis and the cornerstone of tuberculosis control. Different diagnostic methods for an assured diagnosis of TB are necessary. Chest radiography is a useful keystone to identify tuberculosis, but diagnosis of tuberculosis cannot be established by radiography alone. CT scanning is used in patients without pathological chest radiography but clinically suspected active TB and to differentiate TB from other diseases."}, {"query": "What technology was used to identify mRNAs that are differentially expressed in a human neuronal cell line during chronic lithium treatment for bipolar disorder?", "doc1": "X monosomic mice (39,XO) have a remarkably mild phenotype when compared to women with Turner syndrome (45,XO). The generally accepted hypothesis to explain this discrepancy is that the number of genes on the mouse X chromosome which escape X inactivation, and thus are expressed at higher levels in females, is very small. However this hypothesis has never been tested and only a small number of genes have been assayed for their X-inactivation status in the mouse.", "doc2": "The mechanisms underlying lithium's therapeutic efficacy in the chronic treatment of bipolar disorder are not clearly understood. Useful insights can be obtained by identifying genes that are differentially regulated during chronic lithium treatment. Toward this end, we have used microarray technology to identify mRNAs that are differentially expressed in a human neuronal cell line that has been continuously maintained in therapeutic levels of lithium for 33 days.

Therefore, PS1 function is closely linked to the gamma-secretase processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Given the ongoing controversy on the subcellular localization of PS1, it remains unclear at what level of the secretory and endocytic pathways PS1 exerts its activity on APP and on the APP carboxy-terminal fragments that are the direct substrates for gamma-secretase.", "doc2": "To assess the pharmacokinetics of dapivirine in plasma and dapivirine concentrations in cervicovaginal fluids (CVF) and cervicovaginal tissues following vaginal administration of dapivirine microbicide gel in healthy, HIV-negative women for 10 days.

To date, 60 different mutations have been characterized, and a reasonably straightforward phenotype-genotype correlation has been suggested.

Growing evidence supports a role for platelets in the manifestation of tissue damage following I/R. Spleen tyrosine kinase has been well documented to be important in lymphocyte activation and more recently in platelet activation. We performed experiments to evaluate whether inhibition of platelet activation through inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase prevents tissue damage after mesenteric I/R injury.
